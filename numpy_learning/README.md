# NumPy Learning
This folder contains NumPy practice files and a project where I applied NumPy concepts to improve my previous Python project. The goal is to strengthen my NumPy skills before moving on to more advanced topics like Pandas and Machine Learning.

## Projects and Topics Covered:

### 1. **Expense Tracker (NumPy Version)**
   - An upgraded version of my Python Expense Tracker using NumPy arrays for managing and analyzing expenses.
   - **Features:**
     - Add expenses with amount, category, description, and date.
     - View and sort expenses by date or category using NumPy sorting.
     - Record income and calculate total expenses and remaining balance using NumPy operations.
     - Save and load expenses as JSON for persistence.

### 2. **NumPy Practice Files**
   - Several Python files containing exercises and practice for:
     - Array creation, initialization, and data types.
     - Accessing, slicing, and changing arrays.
     - Mathematical operations with NumPy.
     - Reorganizing arrays
     - File handling using NumPy.
     - Hands-on exercises to reinforce learning.

## Learning Objectives:
   - Understand and apply NumPy arrays and operations.
   - Improve data manipulation skills using NumPy before moving to Pandas.
   - Strengthen Python programming foundation for data science projects.

## How to Use the Expense Tracker:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the `numpy_learning` folder.
3. Run `expense_tracker_numpy.py` in a Python 3 environment.
4. Follow the on-screen prompts to add expenses, view them, and track your spending.

## Future Improvements:
- Transition the project to Pandas for more advanced data handling.
- Add visualizations for expenses over time.

Feel free to explore the code and practice files to see how NumPy is applied in real examples. Enjoy learning NumPy!
