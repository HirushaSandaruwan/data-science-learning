# Python Basics Learning

This folder contains Python basics projects, exercises, and summaries to track my learning as I progress through the basics of Python programming. The goal is to master fundamental Python concepts before moving to more advanced topics like NumPy, Pandas, and Machine Learning.

## Projects and Topics Covered:
- **Python Basics Summary**: An overview of key concepts learned so far.
- **Future Projects**: Projects such as the To-Do List app, built using Python, to manage tasks.

## Learning Objectives:
- Gain a solid understanding of Python syntax and concepts.
- Build small Python projects to apply the concepts learned.
- Prepare for data science, machine learning, and other advanced topics.

Feel free to explore the code in each project and see how Python basics are applied.
