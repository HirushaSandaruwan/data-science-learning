# Python Basics Learning

This folder contains Python basics projects, exercises, and summaries to track my learning as I progress through the basics of Python programming. The goal is to master fundamental Python concepts before moving on to more advanced topics like NumPy, Pandas, and Machine Learning.

## Projects and Topics Covered:

### 1. **Expense Tracker**
   - A simple expense tracker built using Python to help manage and track personal expenses.
   - **Features:**
     - Add expenses with amount, category, and description.
     - View and sort expenses by date or category.
     - Record income and calculate total expenses and remaining balance.
     - Save expenses to a JSON file for persistence.

### 2. **Python Basics Summary**
   - An overview of key concepts learned so far in Python.

## Learning Objectives:
   - Gain a solid understanding of Python syntax and concepts.
   - Build small Python projects to apply the concepts learned.
   - Prepare for data science, machine learning, and other advanced topics.

## How to Use the Expense Tracker:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the `python-basics` folder.
3. Run `expense_tracker.py` in a Python 3 environment.
4. Follow the on-screen prompts to add expenses, view them, and track your spending.

## Future Improvements:
- Add data visualization to display expenses over time.
- Implement advanced error handling and input validation.
- Refactor code to make it more modular and efficient.

Feel free to explore the code in each project and see how Python basics are applied. Enjoy learning Python!
