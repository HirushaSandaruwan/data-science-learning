# Pandas Mini Project – Student Score Analysis

This folder contains a **mini project** demonstrating the use of **pandas** for data cleaning, transformation, and analysis.

## Project Overview

The project uses a `students.csv` dataset to practice and showcase the following **pandas functionalities**:

- Inspecting data with `.info()` and `.head()`
- Removing duplicates and handling missing values
- Adding new calculated columns (`Total_score`, `Grade`)
- Categorizing values using `pd.cut`
- Basic data analysis:
  - Calculating mean scores
  - Grouping data by gender
  - Finding top-performing students
- Saving the cleaned dataset as `cleaned_student.csv`

## Dataset

- `students.csv`: Original dataset containing student scores in Math, Science, and English, along with gender information.
- `cleaned_student.csv`: Resulting dataset after cleaning and transformations.

## Purpose

This mini project demonstrates practical usage of pandas for **data cleaning, analysis, and simple feature engineering**. It's a good stepping stone towards more complex pandas projects and data science workflows.
