# My Data Science Learning Journey

Welcome! I’m **Hirusha Sandaruwan**, a first-year student at the **University of Sri Jayewardenepura, Sri Lanka**, learning Python to pursue a career in **Data Science**. This repository documents my Python practice, projects, and growth as I build a strong foundation in programming and data analysis.

## Topics Covered So Far

* **Variables & Data Types:** Understanding and using different Python data types.  
* **Loops:** Iterating over data with `for` and `while` loops.  
* **Functions:** Writing reusable code for simplification.  
* **Conditionals:** Making decisions with `if-else` statements.  
* **Lists & Tuples:** Managing collections of data.  
* **Error Handling:** Gracefully handling exceptions and invalid inputs.  
* **Expense Tracker Project:** Applied Python basics in a practical project.

## Recent Progress

* **NumPy Learning:**  
  * Practice files and exercises exploring arrays, indexing, reshaping, mathematics, file handling, and more.  
  * **Expense Tracker (NumPy Version):** Rebuilt the original project using NumPy arrays for storage and calculations while keeping the same functionality.

* **Pandas Learning:**  
  * Practice files using real CSV datasets.  
  * Exercises covering DataFrames, filtering, merging, grouping, and statistical analysis.  
  * Mini project analyzing student scores with aggregation, grouping, and cleaning.  
  * **Expense Tracker (Pandas Version):** Full-featured tracker using Pandas for more powerful data handling and analysis.

## Upcoming Topics

* **Pandas:** Advanced data manipulation and analysis.  
* **SQL:** Storing, querying, and analyzing data in relational databases.  
* **Matplotlib:** Data visualization using plots, charts, and graphs.  
* **Seaborn:** Statistical data visualization with enhanced styling and themes.  
* **Machine Learning:** Exploring algorithms and techniques for predictive analytics.
