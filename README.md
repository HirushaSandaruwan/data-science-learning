# My Python Learning Journey

Welcome to my Python learning repository! I'm a first-year student learning Python to pursue a career in **data science**. This repository contains my Python practice code and projects, where I focus on building a strong foundation in Python programming.

As I progress, I will be adding more projects related to **data analysis**, **machine learning**, and other exciting Python applications!

## Topics Covered So Far:
- **Variables & Data Types**: Understanding and using different data types in Python.
- **Loops**: Iterating over data with `for` and `while` loops.
- **Functions**: Writing reusable code to simplify tasks.
- **Conditionals**: Making decisions in code using `if-else` statements.
- **Lists & Tuples**: Managing collections of data.
- **Error Handling**: Handling exceptions and invalid input gracefully.

## Upcoming Topics:
- **NumPy**: Working with numerical data and arrays.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **Machine Learning**: Exploring algorithms and techniques for predictive analytics.

## My Goal:
To master Python basics and then transition to more advanced topics like **NumPy**, **Pandas**, and **Machine Learning**.

## Files:
- **`python_basics_summary.py`**: A summary of Python basics with practical examples.
- **`README.md`**: An overview of my Python learning journey and progress.
