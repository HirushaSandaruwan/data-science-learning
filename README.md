# My Data Science Learning Journey

Welcome to my Python learning repository! I'm **Hirusha Sandaruwan**, a first-year student at the **University of Sri Jayewardenepura, Sri Lanka**, learning python to pursue a career in data science. This repository contains my Python practice code and projects, where I focus on building a strong foundation in Python programming.

As I progress, I will be adding more projects related to data analysis, machine learning, and other exciting Python applications!

## Topics Covered So Far:
- **Variables & Data Types**: Understanding and using different data types in Python.
- **Loops**: Iterating over data with `for` and `while` loops.
- **Functions**: Writing reusable code to simplify tasks.
- **Conditionals**: Making decisions in code using `if-else` statements.
- **Lists & Tuples**: Managing collections of data.
- **Error Handling**: Handling exceptions and invalid input gracefully.
- **Expense Tracker Project** : Applied the python basics I learned.

## Recent Progress:
- **NumPy Learning Folder**: Contains practice files and exercises to explore NumPy concepts like arrays, indexing, reshaping, mathematics, file handling, and more.
- **Expense Tracker (NumPy Version)**: Rebuilt the previous Expense Tracker project using NumPy arrays for data storage and calculations, while keeping the same features.

## Upcoming Topics:
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **Machine Learning**: Exploring algorithms and techniques for predictive analytics.

## My Goal:
To master Python basics, NumPy, and Pandas, then transition to Machine Learning and Data Science projects.

## Files and Folders:
- **python-basics/**: Python basics projects and exercises.
  - `expense_tracker.py` : First project built using Python basics.
  - `python_summary.py` : A summary of Python basics with practical examples.
- **numpy_learning/**: NumPy practice files and upgraded Expense Tracker.
  - `expense_tracker_numpy.py` : Expense Tracker upgraded using NumPy arrays.
  - `dataset.txt` + other NumPy practice files.

## How to Use This Repository:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/HirushaSandaruwan/data-science-learning.git

Feel free to explore my code and follow along with my learning journey! 🚀
