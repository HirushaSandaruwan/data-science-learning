# My Data Science Learning Journey

Welcome to my Python learning repository! I'm **Hirusha Sandaruwan**, a first-year student at the **University of Sri Jayewardenepura, Sri Lanka**, learning Python to pursue a career in data science. This repository contains my Python practice code and projects, where I focus on building a strong foundation in Python programming.

As I progress, I will be adding more projects related to data analysis, machine learning, and other exciting Python applications!

## Topics Covered So Far:
- **Variables & Data Types**: Understanding and using different data types in Python.
- **Loops**: Iterating over data with `for` and `while` loops.
- **Functions**: Writing reusable code to simplify tasks.
- **Conditionals**: Making decisions in code using `if-else` statements.
- **Lists & Tuples**: Managing collections of data.
- **Error Handling**: Handling exceptions and invalid input gracefully.
- **Expense Tracker Project** : Applied the python basics I learned.

## Upcoming Topics:
- **NumPy**: Working with numerical data and arrays.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **Machine Learning**: Exploring algorithms and techniques for predictive analytics.

## My Goal:
To master Python basics and then transition to more advanced topics like NumPy, Pandas, and Machine Learning.

## Files:
- **python_basics_summary.py**: A summary of Python basics with practical examples.
- **README.md**: An overview of my Python learning journey and progress.

## How to Use This Repository:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/HirushaSandaruwan/data-science-learning.git
